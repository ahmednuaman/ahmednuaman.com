		<description>
			The Google Advertising Landscape (GAL for short) is an internal Google Sales tool created to aid DSOs sell Google, YouTube and GCN inventory to media buyers. It streamlines the creation of presentations, allowing sales officers to pick and customise case studies and elements to help them create the perfect pitch. I created the content management system (CMS) that the sales officers used to create their own GAL presentations. Its front-end was written in XHTML, CSS and JavaScript (jQuery) and back-end is powered by CodeIgnitor (PHP) and MySQL.

		<description>
			The YouTube Advertising Showcase is a tool that allows advertisers to see the different and innovative examples of YouTube's inventory ranging from expandable MPUs/LRECs to mastheads and brand channels. All the examples are video captured to help advertisers see the user journey. I created the front-end showcase, due to feature on YouTube, and the back-end CMS for sales officers to create and modify examples. The front and back-ends are built with Flex MXML and Actionscript 3 and uses Google App Engine (Python) for data storage and API functions.

		<description>
			As part of my work at Google, I not only had to develop internal and external applications, but I was also brought into projects as a designer. I was asked multiple times to come up with YouTube Brand Channel concepts for clients ranging from TopGear, BMW, Ford to GE. To create these brand channels, one must have an understanding of what YouTube is about (community videos), how and why YouTubers participate in competitions, and how to use the YouTube APIs.

		<description>
			The Davos Debates 2009 were a great way that YouTube helped users post their responses and feelings on major questions to the world's leaders. It featured a full custom brand channel gadget, created by me in Actionscript 2, and uses the YouTube Contest API with a Google App Engine (Python) proxy. The gadget proved to be highly successful and a first for YouTube.

		<description>
			YouTube's Symphony Orchestra was a new and innovative projects that involved the YouTube community submitting videos of themselves and voting for their favourites to win a part in a special orchestra summit in New York's Carnegie Hall. I was brought in to help the guys with the project, on a Friday (two days before it went live), as they were having problems with the YouTube and Google GData APIs. I introduced them to the classes that I wrote for the Davos channel and helped them in integrating the player into their custom carousel and video wall.

		<description>
			During my time at Google, I decided to learn as much as I could about the Google GData and YouTube APIs. I decided to do a mash-up between last.fm and YouTube, whereby it would query last.fm and return a set of artists, tracks or albums, depending on your specification, and then take this to YouTube and return the highest ranking video. It's turned out to be a great way for people to get the latest gossip and tracks from their favourite artists and has had over 50,000 visitors since October 2008.

		<description>
			The Coutts Location Tool is a project that I created whilst working at Tangozebra, now part of Google. The client wanted an interactive and intuitive tool that allowed customers to see where Coutts branches are and how to get there. The idea was to embed Google Maps and use the Maps API to integrate fully with set locations as well as geocoding user's post codes and directions to Coutts branches.

		<description>
			Dr Amal Ahmed, my mother, is a registered doctor of Homeopathy. She required a simple, yet modern and sleek web site. I took it upon myself to integrate the new Google Maps Flash API into her web site. As I've had experience using the Google Maps JavaScript API, the Actionscript 3 version wasn't much different, but hadn't yet got all the features of the JavaScript one. The result was a simple Google Map integrated into the web site.

		<description>
			Mandy Marshall is a photographer who I had the pleasure to work with in a previous job. She wanted a clean, modern web site but did not require the complexity of a CMS. I proposed the idea of having her upload her photos to Flickr and for my to build a web site that fed off the Flickr API and presented her photos on her own web site. The front-end is built with Actionscript 3 and MXML and uses a PHP based proxy system to interact with Flickr's API.

		<description>
			Mosaicappeals.com is a project that I created in a previous job. The concept was to create a self service style web site that allow charities and fund-raisers to come along and create a mosaic from any picture and have those tiles sold to the general public. The tiles sold would then count towards the charity's/fund-raiser's total. The system is built entirely on CodeIgnior (PHP) and uses XHTML, CSS, and JavaScript (Prototype and Script.aculo.us) for the front-end. The system also uses a Protx 3Dsecure API that I wrote.

It was a good income and a huge learning curve because it taught me everything that I know today about design, coding, running a business, and client communication.
