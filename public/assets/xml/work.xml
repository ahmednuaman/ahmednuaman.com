        This was quick project I picked up from the agency and had to add all the nice Facebook features such as the like button, posting on one's wall and inviting friends. I then also had to resize the application so it fitted within the dimensions of the Facebook canvas frame and then build an entirely new section for the results of the voting.

        This was a project where I was bought in to help it move forward to the next stage. I worked closely with a great digital agency and hope to work with them in the future. My job was to create the 3D wall part of the channel, so essentially I had to create a whole new sterile display container that wouldn't mess about with the tiles, popups and the click events. It was a lot of trial and error and after a sleepy 5am launch, it's all looking good now.

        This was another project that was given to me at the 11th hour. The developer who had been working on it could no longer handle the bug fixes in the timescale left to get it live so it was up to me to quickly pick up the codebase and go through and make a number of fixes. The biggest problem was that the previous developer had decided to use Away3D so the main navigation cross was incredibly slow. Instead, I just wrote a 3D engine using Flash Player 10's native 3D APIs and now it's much faster!

            This was a personal record breaker of a channel! I built this bad-boy of a gadget in a day! Oh yes, that quick. The best part was that the agency knew exactly what they wanted so there were no changes! It's just recently gone live and hit all the deadlines within good time.

        This was project YouTube asked me to work on to extend the current YouTube Search Stories web site. The idea was to make a set of Flash components (video player, audio player and cross-domain uploader) as well as the main gadget and make sure that they're all fully internationalised for different languages. The example given here is the Polish version; the Russian version has gone live too and more to come soon!

        This project started out as a proof of concept: create a tool that crowd sources web testing. The process started by using a JavaScript/AJAX style template, but due to cross-domain securities and IE, we settled for the awesome Adobe AIR environment. This, in fact, was the first desktop AIR application I've built that uses Facebook OAuth, which provides simple authentication as well as good user metrics.

		I got this as a late minute project, it was simply to code up the front and back end of the contest, using YouTube to host entry videos and a custom microsite contest API to handle submissions, views and votes. The client mentioned that they didn't mind it being built in Flash, but I opted to do it in HTML, JavaScript and CSS so it would be tablet compatible for all you iPad lovers.

		This was a really fun project to work on. It was the first time I worked with BBH and I really hope it's not the last. The concept was simple: create a custom gadget that integrated with the YouTube Contest API and also the GData API to allow OAuth session creation so that users can rate, upload and subscribe to videos and the channel as well as submitting a video without having to authenticate multiple times.

		This was a very last minute project that I had the chance to work on. On my meeting to another project, I received a call from the creative agency asking for my help to get this YouTube and GCN centric campaign off the ground and turned around within 4 working days. It started off with a multi-stage YouTube brand channel that coincided with the launch of the teasers and adverts for the new 3D LED TV. I then also had to work on MPUs and a masthead for the YouTube homepage. Overall it was a pretty awesome project, one that had to be done quite fast (within 16 working days) and one that's come off pretty well.

		This was a nice and quick project. Create a branded contest channel for the YouTube Cannes Lions contest. Essentially this included incorporating a standard YouTube contest gadget, but then integrating a smart countdown and other key aspects of the design within a new gadget frame and then supplying that for the channel. It looks nice, I'm sure you'd agree.

		This has been a huge milestone project for me. It started out late last year and has been a great part of my working relationship with the guys and gals at YouTube and Google UK. The D&amp;AD Inspiration channel is creative showcase in the field of commercial creativity. It's free to enter and work isn't judged by a panel of D&amp;AD judges, instead it's showcased to the world of creativity through this gadget. It features a unique hexagon scrolling interface (for which the maths was hard) and integrates with a middle tier proxy system as well as YouTube GData feeds and the YouTube Contest API.

		This was a quick and simple fix to a very high pressure campaign. Long story short: I got a call, on a Friday, telling me that this masthead was due to be served on YouTube (via DoubleClick) on a Monday and it didn't contain any DoubleClick components. Now since DoubleClick Studio components are essentially ported TangoZebra components and with all the work I did with DoubleClick, I knew how to fix this with my eyes closed. So, I went through the creative and it was ready to be served by Sunday night, just in time for Monday.

		It's been a crazy start to 2010 with lots and lots of work under my belt and one was developing the Google/YouTube Italy's That's Opera Talent Contest. It's a YouTube contest where entrants compete to win tickets to the 56° Festival Puccini in the summer. They enter by submitting a video of themselves singing or playing an instrument to music of Madam Butterfly Opera. The contest is a full custom built gadget and uses Google Appengine Python backend for email verification and as a proxy between the user and the contest API.

		I was given the amazing opportunity by the guys at The PPC to work on the Avatar interactive trailer microsite. It wasn't the simplest of builds, but the concept was pretty simple. The biggest issue was making sure that the Flash could handle the rendering of the alpha channel videos with 3D panels without dragging too much processing power. The outcome was pretty perfect, although had I had more time I would've spent more time trying to claim back every bit of processing power!

			I recently got asked to help fix and put the finishing touches to Google's new 'Give Chrome' campaign. The site's server side code had to be rewritten in Python for Google's AppEngine, and the Actionscript code had to be cleaned up and updated, ready for working Facebook and Twitter integration and utilising the giving concept. It was a large project to take on, but I managed to get everything up and running within a couple of days, more work to come though!

		A month of so ago I got contacted by an agency in the states who asked me to help them build a beast of a YouTube Contest Gadget for the Olympics IOC. The concept, 'The Best Of Us Challenge', was to have videos of athletes doing stuff that us mere mortals can compete with, such as, walking on your hands or balancing balls. It's a beautifully designed gadget and my task was to aid the team through the maze that is a YouTube Contest Gadget, helping with coding, integration of the player, the authentication and uploading of videos, creation of the proxy (and caching) all the way through to the tech review process. The site has now gone on to win an FWA SOTD Award!
