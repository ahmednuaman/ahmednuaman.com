			I set Ahmed what might have been an impossible task - to detect if a person blinks using a webcam and Flash. Though a lot of hard work, and great tenacity, Ahmed achieved excellent results. It was a pleasure working with Ahmed, and I look forward to working with him again in the near future

			Ahmed is a very knowledgeable developer, expert in the field of Flash development. He is friendly easy to communicate with and reliable. On the project he worked for me he worked very hard under tough conditions and within a very difficult timescale and over delivered at every stage of the project. Would highly recommend Ahmed as a developer who can deliver high quality applications in an excellent timescale

			An exceptionally talented front end developer. Always eager to get the job done and push the boundaries. Probably one of the best front end developers I have had the pleasure to work with and I would certainly work with him again in the future.

			Convincing Ahmed to join us after TangoZebra and Google was one of the biggest human resourcing achievements of modern internet history. Whether or not you consider his inexperience, according to time spent since graduating college, is irrelevant. Ahmed is one of the leading minds when it comes to ActionScript, Flash, designing for the web, utilising common sense, web marketing, you name it. Read his blog his tutorials, and take a look at his portfolio if you don't believe me. He has a solid grasp on the basics of software development which means he just gets it. Within hours he was reading our ruby code and understood the workings of rails. He's had plenty of experience with other MVC frameworks as well. Aside from that he's a great human being, has a voracious appetite for technology, the internet, rich media, KFC and burritos. I will attempt to hire him each and every time I'm in a position to.

			From all the developers that I have paired in the past, there are very few I enjoyed driving with, Ahmed being one of them. Great analytical skills, perfect problem solving approach, has debuggers wrapped around his little finger - both ActionScript and JavaScript. Always going the extra mile, he's a super team player.

			Ahmed is one of those people who's skills span both design and programming, he is very talented at both design and programming. He quickly orientated himself in the creative services team at Google and helped us develop a number of exciting client channel concepts for YouTube as well as creating various gadgets in Actionscript that we still use and offer to clients today. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend him to anyone, and would most definitely re-hire him in the future if needed. Ahmed is not some sort of technogeek but blended in nicely in our team and is a great help in client-facing meetings.

			Ahmed joined our development team initially as a 'stop gap' for a short term month placement - but he's so good we don't want to let him go! Ahmed offers a highly sought after ability which is a sometimes rare combination of a thorough understanding of commercial opportunities along with excellent front end development skills. Ahmed consistently over delivers on expectations. He is innovative and highly motivated. Ahmed is a huge asset to our organisation and our team and is a respected colleague and well liked by all.

			Ahmed is a brilliant developer, who has a strong understanding of a large range of different technologies. He stands out from the crowd by being able to communicate all that is technical to anyone at different degrees of knowledge. Passionate and always increasing his skill and overall a great guy to work with.

			A self-starter who's keen to dive into projects and lend a hand where necessary, and who is also keen to pin-point and start new projects where there is a more long-term need. Not only does Ahmed know a great deal about his own role, but he also understands how to clearly communicate with other colleagues and clients who may not be as experienced or familiar with the topics he is discussing. He is also a very friendly, positive and creative person to work around and can be replied upon to consider and find solutions to challenges you share with him. A massive asset to the team!

			Ahmed's solid work ethic, excellent knowledge and skill base, attention to detail and commitment to ensure the best solution to any dev project has made him an essential member to any project team. His love for his work is always evident, continuing to keep abreast of new technologies and processes, while sharing his knowledge and learnings with his team. He always asks questions, if he is unsure and quickly processes the information and applies his learning accordingly. Ahmed has excellent communication skills, owning the ability to drive a project as well as ensure all stakeholders are kept informed. He is kind, enthusiastic and a pleasure to work with.

			Ahmed is quite frankly a digital prodigy! His broad digital knowledge is incredible, yet his depth of knowledge and practical experience within each of those areas is immense. His interest and passion for digital media is obvious and means that he is always keen to learn as much as he can, both in work and externally. Ahmed is a real asset to our team, he has a rare ability to communicate complex technical issues to non-technically minded staff in a way that is understandable yet not patronising. He also has a great sense of humour, positive 'can-do' attitude and willingness to do whatever is asked of him to the best of his abilities. I would have no hesitation in recommending Ahmed to other people in my position, looking to hire talented digital staff.

			Ahmed was one of my students at Ravensbourne. During his 3 year course he developed from a driven student into a mature thinking designer without managing to loose any of his drive. His dedication to the discipline is awesome.

			Ahmed was one of the most able students I ever taught. It was always a pleasure to work with him in seminars as his ability to combine concept with technology was very inspiring. Consequently his degree project was MA/MSc level. Beyond this his interpersonal skills are excellent and he was very engaged helping in all situations. I would always offer him a place on an MA/MSc program as well as a job.
