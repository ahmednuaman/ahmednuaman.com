				<h3>A quick bio...</h3>
				<div class="cols">
					<p>
						<strong>I design and build web sites and apps.</strong> Most of my projects are development led where I work with the designers and creatives to solve their woes and make their concepts come to life. I also do design and occasionally find myself creating a full experience from wireframes to design and then development, which is awesome.
					</p>
					<p>
						I graduated from Ravensbourne College of Design and Communication in 2007 with a first class BA (hons) in Interaction Design. During my time at college I was very fortunate to work with two very influential tutors (<a href="http://uk.linkedin.com/pub/john-durrant/9/693/5a3">John Durrant</a> and <a href="http://uk.linkedin.com/pub/martin-schmitz/2/735/645">Martin Schmitz</a>) who shaped me into what I am today. Without them, I'd probably be cleaning toilets somewhere.
					</p>
					<p>
						Nowadays I freelance bouncing from project to project. I love it because with the uncertainty of work and the pressure of short deadlines allow me to stay driven to never say no. I love learning new things and I love working on projects that'll push me.
					</p>

							So, how about hiring me?
							<span class="tooltip">
								I make benefit for your glorious project
							</span>
						</a>. I usually work remotely at home in my pants but I understand that from time to time I need to shave and clothe myself to come in for meetings, which is cool as I've got a mighty Brompton!
