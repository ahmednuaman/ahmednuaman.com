# Google Rank

This is a bit of a pointless post, but have just realised where I am on [Google](http://google.com) rankings for the query: "[freelance designer and developer](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=freelance+designer+and+developer)". Now yes, while I do understand that it's got a lot to do with the title of my site, it's just good to know that all those tutorials I'm writing are having a positive effect on my portfolio and blog! Hopefully, might see a rise in site traffic, but I won't sell out with ads ;)
