# Introducing 'The Best Of Us Challenge'

After months of fruition, long transatlantic phone calls and late night code fixes, the fruits of our labour is now live for all to see: [The Olympics 'Best Of Us Challenge'](http://thebestofuschallenge.olympic.org). Go on, see if you can beat them! It's a great gadget and it's really been worth it. I remember when I first got the phone call from the agency, [Mekanism](http://mekanism.com/), who I must say are great and it's been an absolute pleasure working with them, I thought that this is going to be a huge gadget. Again, it took a lot of determination, conference call, and lots and lots of new code and cleaning up of old code to get to this great gadget. Now the last push is sticking it up on the [brand channel](http://youtube.com/thebestofuschallenge) but I'm sure that that's coming very soon! Much love to everyone who I worked with at Mekanism and I hope that they're as proud of it as I am.
