# More tutorials

I've been meaning to write a quick tutorial on how to create a simple carousel style gadget. I've been putting this off for a while as I haven't had time, but I thought that I may as well just get on with it and knock one out! Also, lots of people have been searching for code on my site regarding the creation of YouTube gadgets, especially the 'coverflow' style one. At the moment, I've got a deal going with the authors of [Flashtuts+](http://active.tutsplus.com) whereby I write articles and tutorials for them. It's good as it gets more coverage than just putting them here and it means that I get lots of exposure too. I've currently had two published, [Understanding the PureMVC Open Source Framework](http://active.tutsplus.com/tutorials/workflow/understanding-the-puremvc-open-source-framework/) and [Using the YouTube Player API with ActionScript 3.0](http://active.tutsplus.com/tutorials/video/using-the-youtube-player-api-with-actionscript-30/) and a third one should be published soon on creating a simple YouTube Search and Play gadget. When it comes to expanding on the tutorials, errata and updates, I'll always publish them here. I'll also be putting up snippets of code and just little tips here and there. And of course, any code that I do that's useful but it's big enough for a tutorial, I'll stick it up on here! So bare with me, there'll be lots of content coming up very very shortly!
