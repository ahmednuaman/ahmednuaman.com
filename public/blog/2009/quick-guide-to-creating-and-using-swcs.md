# Quick Guide to Creating and Using SWCs

I've recently had one of my tutorials published on Flashtuts+: [Quick Guide to Creating and Using SWCs](http://active.tutsplus.com/tutorials/tools-tips/quick-guide-to-creating-and-using-swcs/). It's a quick overlook at how using SWCs can help bridge the gap between the design and development process of a project. You'll quickly learn how you can import visual assets from Photoshop and begin to embed them into your code as classes. Have a read and tell me what you think!
