# Twittering

I've just started twittering now, well in the sense that I've set up my [Twitter](http://twitter.com) page and I've added it to my blog and folio pages. Just need to add stuff now! Follow me: [http://twitter.com/ahmednuaman](http://twitter.com/ahmednuaman). It's as simple as anyone says, although I was a bit annoyed that the background image is fixed to top left and you can't center it! Oh well, boring gradient it is...
