# My Business Cards

So I've done a design for the business cards I'm going to get ordered. It's pretty plain, simple, not boring I hope, but I'd like to get the general consensus before I get them printed, so do tell me what you think. ![ahmednuaman.com-portfolio-businesscard-1-front](http://ahmednuaman.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/ahmednuaman.com-portfolio-businesscard-1-front.png) ![ahmednuaman.com-portfolio-businesscard-1-back](http://ahmednuaman.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/ahmednuaman.com-portfolio-businesscard-1-back.png)

**[Ahmed](#242 "2009-10-02 07:43:15"):** Yeah that's a fair suggestion, but then we get into copyright issues and getting a bit cluttered. I'd want them to come to my site really...

**[Yamel](#249 "2009-10-23 14:19:43"):** Hi, I am new on your site and I quite found really cool how you used the diagonal on your graphics (all your examples are on an angle), I love that your biz card are simple, I thought also it could be cool if you integrated that diagonal into your biz card. So text would be flowing with the same angle...

**[lovelyuthara](#264 "2009-11-23 09:22:44"):** Well its nice but not very creative and attractive. Simple things are good but little creativity needed Dear. A business cards should be creative and attractive as well as simple. :)
