# Twidgit for Android

A few weeks back, my colleague [Matt Woodfield](http://twitter.com/disretrospect) began playing with the [Android SDK](http://code.google.com/android/) and from that [Twidgit Lite](http://market.android.com/search?q=pub:disretrospect) was born! It's simply a little widget that you can place on your Android phone's desktop and set the interval at which it gets the latest tweet on your profile! It's a great tool! Compared to the likes of Twidroid and other Twitter Android apps, Twidgit has a fantastic interface, something that's quite rare amongst Android Apps. Don't take my word for it, here's some screen-shots (through the emulator!):
