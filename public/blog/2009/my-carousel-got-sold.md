# My Carousel Got Sold!

When I showed the YouTube team in the states my [3D Carousel Demo](http://youtube.com/3dcarouseldemo) and [Perspective Carousel Demo](http://youtube.com/perspectivecarousel) they gave it lots of praise and lots of new ideas. For example, they suggested that tracking would be a necessity. So I'm still developing on the ideas they gave me, but yesterday, out of the blue, I got an instant message on my G1 from one of the tech producers in NYC saying that they've been showing it to clients and the American Army National Guard are looking to take on my carousel and use it for their YouTube Brand Channel. Awesome. Except it means now I'll defiantly have to develop it as a proper product rather than a concept of component. But that's good, it'll mean that I'll be adding to YouTube's range of products. However, it's always got to go through a long review process and since my contract with Google expires in June I don't think I'll be building a fully fledged product. Nevertheless, that's all good, as now I see it as an opportunity to market my skills in creating custom brand channel gadgets for YouTube. The main thing now is to get as many contacts as I can so that instead of agencies being handed the task that they then find too much, it can go to me, someone who knows what they're doing.
