# My Latest Tutorial: Creating a YouTube Search and Play Gadget with PureMVC

I've had another of my tutorials published on the Flashtuts+ network[: Creating a YouTube Search and Play Gadget with PureMVC](http://active.tutsplus.com/tutorials/video/creating-a-youtube-search-and-play-gadget-with-puremvc/). It's a simple step by step guide on how to build a little gadget and teaches you three main things: 

  1. Using PureMVC
  2. Using the YouTube Player API in AS3
  3. Working with GData
[Check it out](http://active.tutsplus.com/tutorials/video/creating-a-youtube-search-and-play-gadget-with-puremvc/) and tell me what you think!
