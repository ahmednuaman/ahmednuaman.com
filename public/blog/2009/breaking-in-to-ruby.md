# Breaking in to Ruby

Well my residency at [Google](http://google.com)/[YouTube](http://youtube.com)/[TangoZebra](http://tangozebra.com) is now over and I'm moving on to newer and brighter things! I've got a month booked at [Enrich Productions](http://www.enrichproductions.net/) in London where I've been told I will be working with Ruby! Uh oh, my Ruby skills need some work, so it's out with the old books and tutorials all weekend I think! A few years ago I bought two books on Ruby, both from [The Pragmatic Programmers](http://pragprog.com/). I've only just started reading the first one, [Agile Web Development with Rails](http://pragprog.com/titles/rails3/agile-web-development-with-rails-third-edition), but already it's turning out to be well written. It's a big book but the font's a decent size so even a dyslexic like me can read it. Well, hopefully anything I learn that's of good use I'll post back up here, the main thing to do now is to set up my iMac so it's ready for web development!
