# New, Shiny and Improved YouTube Wrapper

Recently I published an update to the YouTube wrapper I use for all Actionscript 3 YouTube projects. It's now all up on my [Github](http://github.com/ahmednuaman/YouTube-Player-Wrapper/tree/master) with some improvements on the older version. The new version comes with an improved local connection, and also some more options such as: you can now resize the player without having to reload it! Have a play with it, tell me what you think. I'm looking to have some more options added such as additional pausing and resuming.

**[Ikzy](#192 "2009-09-08 11:23:10"):** i've downloaded it but i need the : com.firestartermedia.lib.as3.display.component.video:YouTubePlayer lib.. I can't find it on github :(

**[Ikzy](#193 "2009-09-08 11:27:13"):** Ah, there was a master with the AS3 folder.. found it! will try to get it working now :) thanks

**[Ahmed](#194 "2009-09-08 12:14:58"):** Glad you found it. If you check out the repo, you can keep it up to date with all the changes I make! And also feel free to fork if you have any improvements!

**[Ahmed](#231 "2009-09-25 13:47:46"):** Sorry about that! I'll fix that and I'll do some docs! I've got lots on at the moment. Is there any reason you want to use the chromeless player?

**[Ikzy](#229 "2009-09-25 12:59:31"):** you can't pause the chromeless player?

**[Ikzy](#230 "2009-09-25 13:00:47"):** it would be so handy to have some kind of documentation on this :X
