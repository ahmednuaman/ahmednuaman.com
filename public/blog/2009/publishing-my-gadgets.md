# Publishing My Gadgets

I recently re-found (if that's a word?) [widgetbox.com](http://widgetbox.com) where developers can upload widget's they've created and share them with the community. Now a lot of my work at Google and YouTube has been centered around developing gadgets and widgets using the Google Gadgets API. So I've taken it upon myself to make sure that I publish all the gadgets I create on there that I'm happy for people to use. One of the first gadgets I created as a little test to see how to use the YouTube API. It's a simple gadget that reads a feed from Last.fm and then gets YouTube videos. You're able to put in your Last.fm username and it will get your favourite tracks/artists/albums and then query YouTube for the popular videos. It's a great way to find new music! If you're interested here's the [iGoogle Gadget link](http://www.google.com/ig/directory?type=gadgets&url=cs-stage5.tangozebra.com/80364/ahmed/Player.xml) and here's the [widgetbox.com](http://www.widgetbox.com/widget/ahmednuaman-lastfm-youtube-mashup-v1) link. Just for a quick preview, here's the gadget itself:
