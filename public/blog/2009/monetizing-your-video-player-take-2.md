# Monetizing Your Video Player (Take 2)

So, [last time I spoke about monetizing a video player](http://ahmednuaman.com/blog/2009/09/07/monetising-your-video-player-with-tremor-mediaacudeo-ad-manager/), I was tasked with integrating [Tremor Media](http://www.tremormedia.com/) components. That failed spectacularly because the dev team there, well, aren't helpful. So, I then told the sales guys I was working with: "Tremor Media isn't going to work, what's the plan?". The pointed me to [LiveRail](http://www.liverail.com/). And this was awesome... I'm writing this posts 20 minutes after I started integrating the pre/mid/end rolls advertising wrapper into the player, it's that easy. Seriously, these guys need a hand because it works, really really well. So thank you LiveRail, you guys should pat yourselves on the back, as for Tremor Media: shame on you...
