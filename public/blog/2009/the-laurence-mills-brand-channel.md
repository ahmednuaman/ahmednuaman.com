# The Laurence Mills Brand Channel

I was asked by my friend, [Laurence Mills](http://youtube.com/laurencemills), to help him set up a simple micro site where he could upload shorts and showreels. I convinced him to have a YouTube Brand Channel rather than creating a web site and it getting lost in the ocean of the internet. Looking at his work and knowing what he likes, I created a nice and simple grunge and worn style background. I then got him to put his set up his playlists so I could implement the [3D Carousel Gadget I created for YouTube](/blog/2009/05/11/youtube-3d-carouselyoutube-3d-carousel/). It took a while to convince Laurence the beauty of using YouTube over a micro site, but he's pleased with it now and hopefully it should drum up lots of exposure for him and his work, [check it out](http://youtube.com/laurencemills): [![Laurence Mills Brand Channel Screenshot](http://ahmednuaman.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/laurencemills_screenshot.jpg)](http://youtube.com/laurencemills)
