# Introducing The 'Give Chrome' Campaign

Now this may have been the most work I've ever done hung over. During the week that just past, I've been working with the guys and gals at Google UK on a few top secret projects. They've all been bubbling quite nicely, and have given me enough time to explore different technologies and techniques to make the projects awesome. However, to the end of the week a huge fire cropped up: the '[Give Chrome](http://givechrome.com)' campaign needed my help. So on the '[Give Chrome](http://givechrome)' microsite you can give the joy of [Chrome](http://www.google.co.uk/chrome) as a present to someone else, just like you'd send a link to someone but of course with some nice cool moving graphics. However, there were some huge bugs with it, for example, the server side code didn't work, parts of the Flash weren't working correctly and integration with [Facebook](http://facebook.com) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com) failed. However, after a very late night on Thursday, a hectic day on Friday and a hung over Saturday, it's all back to work and generating [quite a buzz](http://twitter.com/#search?q=givechrome), which is always good! So, why not [give Chrome](http://givechrome)? I've left Safari for it and I like it :D
