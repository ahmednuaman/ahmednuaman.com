# My First Tutorial

Like I mentioned a few posts ago, I've started writing tutorials for [Flashtuts+](http://active.tutsplus.com/) so I can raise my profile as a skilled freelancer. My first tutorial has been published on [Flashtuts+](http://active.tutsplus.com/) and is ready for all to see, check it out: [Understanding the PureMVC Open Source Framework](http://active.tutsplus.com/tutorials/workflow/understanding-the-puremvc-open-source-framework/)
