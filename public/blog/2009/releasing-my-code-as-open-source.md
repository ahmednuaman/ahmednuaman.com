# Releasing My Code as Open Source

**Update: after a disastrous morning, I'm going to try and upload everything tomorrow!** When I first started this blog, I had every intention of releasing my code as open source for everyone to take and use. I'm still going to do this, in fact I'm just getting my repositories ready for uploading. I've decided to use [Github](http://github.com) rather than SVN'ing to Google Code. I do prefer git a lot more over svn, but if you really want me to use Google Code, I'm sure I can upload to there too, only by popular demand though! **The Repositories** So here's the juicy info on the location of the repos on Github: 

  * [PHP: https://github.com/ahmednuaman/PHP](https://github.com/ahmednuaman/PHP)
  * [AS2: https://github.com/ahmednuaman/AS2](https://github.com/ahmednuaman/AS2)
  * [AS3: https://github.com/ahmednuaman/AS3](https://github.com/ahmednuaman/AS3)
