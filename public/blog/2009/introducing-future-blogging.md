# Introducing Future Blogging

I should've done this earlier, but didn't have the time! About a month ago, I finished the full redesign of [Future Blogging's new web site](http://futureblogging.co.uk). It's for my friend Tom Lindridge who's gone freelance, and with good purpose. He's the best copywriter I know and his knowledge and perception of the online and social marketing worlds is enough to help anyone's business in whatever sector. So [check him out](http://futureblogging.co.uk), and also give me a heads up if you like the [site](http://futureblogging.co.uk).
