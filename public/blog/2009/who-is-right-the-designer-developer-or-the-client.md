# Who is Right? The Designer (/Developer) or The Client?

Back when I was at uni ([Ravensbourne College of Design and Communication](http://rave.ac.uk)) I wrote my third year dissertation about a touchy subject. It was simply to see different people's views about how they handle certain clients, or how clients handle designer/developer direction. Recently [SmashingMagazine.com](http://smashingmagazine.com) tweeted this: 

> [@smashingmag](http://twitter.com/smashingmag/): What is the best way for a client to tell designer exactly what he wants? Any ideas, URLs, suggestions?

It made me think about my dissertation, so here it is! I'll be good to know what you think! 

**Please don't steal this dissertation**, it's better to write your own one.
