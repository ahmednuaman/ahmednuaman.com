# The Best Of Us Challenge Wins FWA's Site Of The Day!!

Woohooo!!! Finally, I've worked on a project that's won an FWA award! [The Best Of Us Challenge](http://thebestofuschallenge.olympic.org/) is centred around the YouTube Contest API and involves you, the general public, challenging athletes at a range of different things. There's quite a few different challenges and they're always being updated! The concept is really cool, you watch a video, record your own challenge and upload it. You can also call for a challenge too! Check it out at [http://thebestofuschallenge.olympic.org/](http://thebestofuschallenge.olympic.org/)
