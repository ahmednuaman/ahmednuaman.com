# Introducing 1Click2Fame.com

Here it is, this is what I've been working on for the past two months! It's the new web site for [1Click2Fame.com](http://1Click2Fame.com) where, and I quote, "finding fame is the name of the game". It's owned by the company [Enrich Productions](http://enrichproductions.com) and I was bought in to build them a Flash video player and also little bits of Flashy stuff here and there including the home page carousel and the competition count-down timer. More stuff to follow! The player uses the "ChromelessViewPlayer()" class I've got up on my [Github](http://github.org/ahmednuaman/as3) so there's nothing stopping you from writing your own! It's quite a neat player, even if I say so myself. Not only does it play video, but you can vote through it (and when it comes to rounds you need to be authenticated to vote, so it handles that too, in situ), share and embed the video and also load further videos from the end-frame in situ. Here's a little preview:  So check out [1Click2Fame.com](http://1Click2Fame.com) and tell me what you think!

**[Flv Player](#152 "2009-08-19 10:20:13"):** It seems very simple and best. Don't you add new features?

**[Ahmed](#153 "2009-08-19 16:17:13"):** I have added lots of new features, if there's anything you're interested it, I'll write up how to do it
