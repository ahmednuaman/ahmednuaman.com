# Another Take on the YouTube 3D Carousel

I wrote a [post](/blog/2009/05/11/youtube-3d-carousel/) about a new gadget I created for YouTube Brand Channels. This gadget went down really well with the guys at YouTube and has been pushed to a channel for my friend [Laurnce Mills](/blog/2009/05/12/the-laurence-mills-brand-channel/). However my colleague at work at work mentioned that it may look quite cool if instead of having the thumbnails in a "coverflow" style, have them coming from the back and going towards the user. So I created another gadget and [published it here](http://youtube.com/perspectivecarousel). The [Perspective Carousel](http://youtube.com/perspectivecarousel) (as I call it) is just a simple modification of the [3D Carousel](http://youtube.com/3dcarouseldemo) I created but with the visual difference of how the thumbnails are layed out. So check it out and tell me what you think: [![YouTube Perspective Carousel Demo](http://ahmednuaman.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/perspectivec_screenshot.jpg)](http://youtube.com/perspectivecarousel)
