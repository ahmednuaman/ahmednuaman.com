# Understanding SWCs

So after my tutorial on Flashtuts+ ([Quick Guide to Creating and Using SWCs](http://active.tutsplus.com/tutorials/tools-tips/quick-guide-to-creating-and-using-swcs/)), I've had a few emails and comments about the usage of SWCs. So, after responding to them individually, I've compiled this post so you guys can see what a SWC can help you with and what it can't. **Quick usage with visual assets** So I've just gone and draw a shape in the Flash IDE like so: ![Screen shot 2009-09-29 at 08.06.14](http://ahmednuaman.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/Screen-shot-2009-09-29-at-08.06.14-580x413.png) Now I then convert this shape to a symbol (that's by pressing F8, or going to Modify > Convert to symbol, or dragging into the Library panel) and when it asks me what type, I specify "MovieClip" and call it "RedCircles". I then make sure that I tick the box that left of the "Export for Actionscript" label. This will mean I can use it in my code. And finally, I open up the publish settings of my FLA (by going to File > Publish settings; the keyboard shortcut never works for me, damn IDE) and make sure that in the "Flash" tab under "SWF settings" I tick "Export SWC". Ok, so now we're ready to export our SWC. Make sure you're exporting it to a place where your compiler or IDE (such as [Flash/Flex Builder](http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=flex+builder&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8) or [FDT](http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=fdt&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8)) can access it. With IDEs, you normally have to tell the compiler that the SWC is there, this is quite simple, and there should be [plenty](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&client=safari&rls=en&q=flex+builder+add+swc&aq=f&oq=&aqi=) [of](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&client=safari&rls=en&q=mxmlc+add+swc&aq=f&oq=&aqi=g10) [docs](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&client=safari&rls=en&q=fdt+add+swc&aq=f&oq=&aqi=g1) out there to help you. So know you've created your shape, added it to your development environment, so now let's add it to our application. Remember, our SWC assets (whether they be MovieClip, Button or Bitmap) are display objects, that means they are added to a subclass of the display object class, otherwise that class doesn't have the ability to add children. So, we add the asset like so: ` package { import flash.display.Sprite; [SWF( backgroundColor="#FFFFFF" )] public class App extends Sprite { public function App() { addChild( new RedCircles() ); } } } ` Which gives us: [kml_flashembed publishmethod="static" fversion="10.0.0" movie="http://dev.ahmednuaman.com/swcs/App1.swf" width="580" height="350" targetclass="border"/] Simples eh? Not only can you add just MovieClips, but you can also add buttons with over, down, etc.. states and Bitmaps too. It's quick a nice workflow between the developer and the designer. **How about extending that asset's class?** Right, many ask how to do this, and many more ask why. But the simple truth is that yes, you can extend a SWC's asset, and the reason you may want to is to enable stylings, resizing or just do a bit more. So, for example, when you customise visual components in [Flex](http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=flex&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8), you can add the component, whether they're classes, or links, and then you also have the option to add a component class. This class acts as a mediator between the component you're styling and the asset itself. It can, for example, set its height and width, add children to it, etc... For more info, [read up on my post about styling Flex components](/blog/2009/07/26/skinning-flex-hslider-component/). So, let's assume that you want to extend the SWC asset to change the width, so create a new class, call it "RedCirclesExtended" for example, and paste in the following code: ` package { public class RedCirclesExtended extends RedCircles { public function RedCirclesExtended() { super(); this.width = 200; } } } ` All we're doing here is changing the asset's width to 200. Now, a lot of people get confused here, especially about how to reference the class. This is how you've got to think about it: 

  1. Your asset exists on frame 1 of your application
  2. Your SWC's visual assets extend the display object but have no class path of their own
  3. Therefore your SWC's visual assets are accessible by just calling their class name without having an import path
Please note how I've mentioned them as your _visual_ assets, as a SWC can also be formed of coded classes that _may_ (well _should_) have a class path defined. And remember, SWCs aren't linked into your application, they're actually baked in. So, now we just update our main application file like so: ` package { import flash.display.Sprite; [SWF( backgroundColor="#FFFFFF" )] public class App extends Sprite { public function App() { addChild( new RedCirclesExtended() ); } } } ` And that gives us, drum roll please: [kml_flashembed publishmethod="static" fversion="10.0.0" movie="http://dev.ahmednuaman.com/swcs/App2.swf" width="580" height="350" targetclass="border"/] So, there we have simply extended the visual asset before we used it in our code. This applies for both Actionscript and Flex applications. **So what about work flow?** Well like I said, this is such a good work flow: the designer is confined to doing the assets in the FLA, you then tell them what you want the assets to be called. Now like I mentioned earlier these visual assets exist at the top of the class path, so frame 1. I always tell my designers to follow a strict naming convention: 

Bitmaps start with "BitmapAsset" and then the identifier, and then the variable, such as size or colour; so a logo would be: "BitmapAssetLogoBig" 
  * Buttons start with "ButtonAsset" and again, using the same convention as with Bitmaps, we get: "ButtonAssetEmailUsSmall"
  * Text Fields start with "TextAsset" (of course, they're confined to MovieClips, but ones that contain TextFields only) and again, using the same convention as with Bitmaps and Buttons, we get: "TextAssetHeaderLarge"
  * Now with MovieClips, it's a bit tricky. Some just see MovieClips as what they are, but they are complex things, for example, a MovieClip could just be a vector shape, or it could contain text, buttons and animation, so I've got a naming convention for that too:
    * If the MovieClip **just** contains **one set** visual asset, such as a vector shape or combined shapes and bitmaps that **aren't** interactive or animated, it then is specified as a "SimpleAsset", for example, "SimpleAssetTopLogoLarge" could contain your company's logo as a bitmap and some copy as a textfield. It's not interactive, nor animated.
    * If a MovieClip contains interaction, such as a button, or animation, it's then referred to as a "MixedAsset", for example, "MixedAssetTopMenuWide"
I know some of you are looking at this think "What the frick..." but honestly, this way it saves you overwriting any classes and programmatically constructing the visual side of your application without having to remember irregular class names for assets. So I hope this has helped, tell me if there are more questions.

**[Monkey](#257 "2009-11-13 23:00:46"):** Ho about the pre load of the swc â€“ im using fdt and i usualy use a library swf that holds the assets that i preload ion app init then i can use a pree loader to show progress then i call assets from the library swf. if u use swc i this way how do you show the preloading of assets?

**[Ahmed](#261 "2009-11-18 15:14:20"):** Well with a SWC you don't need to preload anything, it's all baked in at compile time. This does make the application size bigger, but SWCs should only ever contain vector assets, that way your app will stay light weight.

**[Will](#266 "2009-11-24 11:59:13"):** Are SWC's limited to standard Flash types like MovieClips and Buttons? I mean is it possible to attach a custom class to say a MovieClip in the Flash IDE and have access to those custom methods inside of Flex Builder? I'm guessing the answer is no :(

**[Ahmed](#268 "2009-11-25 07:14:35"):** Yes, you can. Remember, SWCs aren't just design assets, they're also code libraries. So you can create an MC in the Flash IDE and then extend it with some AS code and compile that into SWC.
