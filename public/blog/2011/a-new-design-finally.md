# A new design (finally)

It's been a long time coming and after 15 versions I decided to keep things nice and simple. But then grey is so boring, so I made it all blue and up in one's face. After all, what's life without colour? Nevertheless, if it's too bright, see if you can find the hidden minimalist button. I've also removed comments from the blog, why? Disqus was pissing me off and so was WordPress's comment system so I'm gonna use [Google+](/+) for comments now, it makes sense. If you notice any bad links or anything that's out of place, please drop me a [tweet](http://twitter.com/ahmednuaman) or email.
