# A Simple WordPress Carousel Plugin

I recently wrote a custom plugin for WordPress that created a carousel. I then decided to open source it, so, here it is: [https://github.com/ahmednuaman/ahmeds-wordpress-carousel](https://github.com/ahmednuaman/ahmeds-wordpress-carousel) Simply download it, stick it into your wp-content/plugins folder and off you go!
