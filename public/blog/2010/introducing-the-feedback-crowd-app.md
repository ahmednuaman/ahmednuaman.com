# Introducing The Feedback Crowd App

Well, it's been a busy start to my new tax year! I've had lots and lots of projects!! One hugely noticeable project is one I did for the good folks over at [QuBit Digital](http://qubitdigital.com). The idea is simple: create a crowd-sourcing web site tester (if that makes sense). I started with using [HTML5](http://www.google.co.uk/#sclient=psy&hl=en&site=&source=hp&q=html5&aq=f&aqi=g2g-s1g1g-o1&aql=&oq=&gs_rfai=&pbx=1&fp=700fb4d1e2a0842b) and some clever JavaScript, but it was soon very apparent that the damn browser cross domain security settings wasn't going to all me to build a perfect app for us to see how people are using the sites. So in the end I developed it in [Adobe AIR](http://www.google.co.uk/#sclient=psy&hl=en&q=adobe+air&aq=f&aqi=g4g-o1&aql=&oq=&gs_rfai=&pbx=1&fp=700fb4d1e2a0842b) and it's running pretty perfect! It uses [Facebook OAuth](http://www.google.co.uk/#hl=en&expIds=17259,17315,18167,23628,25834,25900,26458,26518,26568&xhr=t&q=facebook+oauth&cp=11&pf=p&sclient=psy&aq=f&aqi=g-s1g3g-o1&aql=&oq=facebook+oa&gs_rfai=&pbx=1&fp=700fb4d1e2a0842b) which means the barriers to entry are very small! Check it out, remember, the more tests you do, the more money raised for charity: [http://www.feedbackcrowd.com](http://www.feedbackcrowd.com)
