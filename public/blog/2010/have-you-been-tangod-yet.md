# Have You Been Tango'd (Yet?)

I can't believe I forgot to mention this. Unless you haven't had a look at my [portfolio](http://ahmednuaman.com), you may not have noticed that about two weeks ago I launched the Tango'd Films YouTube Brand Channel: [http://youtube.com/tango](http://youtube.com/tango). It's a pretty fun channel, the concept is that you take a [Lomax](http://www.myspace.com/lomaxdnb) d'n'b track and do some bad-ass dancing and submit it into the contest running on the channel. [![](http://ahmednuaman.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Screen-shot-2010-07-09-at-08.15.jpg)](http://youtube.com/tango) Have a play and even enter the contest, well, it is for underage people, but yeah, go for it!
