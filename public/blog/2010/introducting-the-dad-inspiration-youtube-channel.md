# Introducting The D&AD Inspiration YouTube Channel

Yes, it's finally up! The D&AD Inspiration YouTube Channel has been probably one of my biggest projects so far. It's a huge channel that allows creatives to upload commercial creatives to the area and have them viewed for free by the wider community. The process isn't judged by D&AD;, it's a free for all really, well, apart from the moderation stage; this makes sure only the best stuff is uploaded. This has been a beast of a channel, having to have a middle tier proxy and caching system and also making full use of the YouTube Contest API and the YouTube GData APIs. It's also allowed me to write a lot of new open source code that's released up on [my github account](http://www.github.com/ahmednuaman). Hopefully you'll enjoy it and upload some stuff too: [http://youtube.com/dandad](http://youtube.com/dandad)
