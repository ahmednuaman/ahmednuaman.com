# So There's This Organ See...

Not too long ago, I inherited an awesome vintage electric organ/keyboard from a friend of mine. Long story short, I haven't used it as much as I've looked at it and thought "wow, that's cool" and it's just taking up too much space (I can't reasonably use is as a cool-ass desk). I won't take it to the tip and charity shops won't take it cos it's old. Needless to say, it still works, magnificently. So if you're feeling it, [please bid on the eBay listing as all the funds go to the NSPCC](http://cgi.ebay.co.uk/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=320559437488&ssPageName=ADME:L:LCA:GB:1123#ht_3068wt_1139). Here's a nice picture: [![](http://ahmednuaman.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/DSC02889-580x386.jpg)]( http://is.gd/dlDJN)
