# Introducing Google/YouTube Italy's That's Opera Talent

It's been a very very very busy start to 2010, but who am I to complain? I've been working on a number of high profile projects and they're all very close to launching. However, the first to launch is a project I built for the Google/YouTube Italy's marketing department: [That's Opera Talent Contest](http://youtube.com/thatsoperatalent). The [Ricordi](http://www.ricordi.co.uk/) sponsored contest is to find opera singers and musicians to win a trip to the 56Â° Festival Puccini in the summer. To be honest, a lot of it is in Italian so there's not a lot I know about the festival! But, if you're Italian is better than mine (Google Translate that is), tell me what goes down.
