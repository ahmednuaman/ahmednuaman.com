# Urgh, Too Much Work

Why am I complaining you may ask? Well, I've got a problem you see: I can't say no to work. This is cool cos I get lots of work, but it's bad cos I work myself into the ground! As I write this now, tired and needing a good sleep, I've just finished some work for a number of clients to show tomorrow. What can I do, I love work! Anyway, that being said, I've got lots of new code to show, including some code I wrote, got screwed over with, and will now post for free for you guys!
