# YouTube Cannes Lions is Go Go Go!

I recently worked on a nice and quick project: [YouTube Cannes Lions 48 Hour Ad Contest](http://youtube.com/canneslions). This is a bright and funky channel that asks the creative types around the world to create a compelling ad (that fits a brief of course) within 48 hours to win a chance to go to Cannes Lions. It's pretty awesome, and it's worth checking out the talent from last year: [http://youtube.com/canneslions](http://youtube.com/canneslions)
