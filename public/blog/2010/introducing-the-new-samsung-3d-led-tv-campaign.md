# Introducing the new Samsung 3D LED TV Campaign

Ah, what a crazy couple of weeks. If you haven't read about this on my portfolio, here's a snippet about this campaign: "This was a very last minute project that I had the chance to work on. On my meeting to another project, I received a call from the creative agency asking for my help to get this YouTube and GCN centric campaign off the ground and turned around within 4 working days. It started off with a multi-stage YouTube brand channel that coincided with the launch of the teasers and adverts for the new 3D LED TV. I then also had to work on MPUs and a masthead for the YouTube homepage. Overall it was a pretty awesome project, one that had to be done quite fast (within 16 working days) and one that's come off pretty well." Yes, it's the morning and I feel lazy! :P But seriously, this was an awesome campaign to work on and there was a very steep learning curve. It wasn't without hiccups, just information getting lost in translation. And then there was the YouTube cache! But now it's all good and the masthead is running on the YouTube web site now for one day (00:00-23:59 28/4/2010) so check it up and get the clicks up: [http://youtube.com/samsung3d](http://youtube.com/samsung3d)

**[Ahmed](#337 "2010-05-14 17:24:42"):** Oh no, not ESP. Stay away, they're useless and still owe me money!

**[INGAAS](#369 "2010-11-16 15:33:15"):** LED TVs have much better contrast and color compared to traditional LCDs .-;

**[Ahmed](#370 "2010-11-21 21:52:40"):** Well, this is a bit of a funny place to talk about LED TVs ;)

**[Polypropylene :](#365 "2010-10-29 16:18:20"):** currently, there are no TRUE LEDtv these days but they are actually LED backlit LCD tvs ~
