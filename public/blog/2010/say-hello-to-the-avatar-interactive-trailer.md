# Say Hello To The Avatar Interactive Trailer

A while back I took part in a project with [The PPC](http://theppcpresents.com/) to build a '[different' microsite](http://www.theppcpresents.com/avatar3d/) for the (then) new film [Avatar](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&client=safari&rls=en&q=avatar&aq=f&aqi=g10&oq=). I don't know what happened to this project, I spent a good while optimising and refactoring to get it running really smoothly but then I got paid and I didn't hear anything else. It seems that it may not have gone out in time, which is a really shame cos it's awesome! Anyway, [have a look](http://www.theppcpresents.com/avatar3d/), tell me what you think.
