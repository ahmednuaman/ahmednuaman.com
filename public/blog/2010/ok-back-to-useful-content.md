# Ok, Back To Useful Content!

It's been a very very long time since I've blogged but I've got a lot of stuff to blog about. This post seems a bit pointless, but it's basically an announcement of some of the stuff I'm going to be blogging about, and they are as follows: 

  * The YouTube Player API
  * Google OAuth API
  * Twitter API
  * Facebook API
  * Some new PHP, AS3 and JS code
  * And my new work!
So, let's start!
