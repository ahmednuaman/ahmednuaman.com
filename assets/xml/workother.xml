			Future Blogging are a new copywriting company who wanted their web site to stand out from the crowd. I pitched the idea of having their web site look and feel like a magazine, as most of their work is copy. The took to the idea, loved it and have had nothing but praise about their bold image. The web site was constructed with Actionscript 2 and uses XML to bind the data.

			Mandy Marshall is a photographer who I had the pleasure to work with in a previous job. She wanted a clean, modern web site but did not require the complexity of a CMS. I proposed the idea of having her upload her photos to Flickr and for my to build a web site that fed off the Flickr API and presented her photos on her own web site. The front-end is built with Actionscript 3 and MXML and uses a PHP based proxy system to interact with Flickr's API.

			Mosaicappeals.com is a project that I created in a previous job. The concept was to create a self service style web site that allow charities and fund-raisers to come along and create a mosaic from any picture and have those tiles sold to the general public. The tiles sold would then count towards the charity's/fund-raiser's total. The system is built entirely on CodeIgnior (PHP) and uses XHTML, CSS, and JavaScript (Prototype and Script.aculo.us) for the front-end. The system also uses a Protx 3Dsecure API that I wrote.
