		<description>
		This has been a huge milestone project for me. It started out late last year and has been a great part of my working relationship with the guys and gals at YouTube and Google UK. The D&amp;AD Inspiration channel is creative showcase in the field of commercial creativity. It's free to enter and work isn't judged by a panel of D&amp;AD judges, instead it's showcased to the world of creativity through this gadget. It features a unique hexagon scrolling interface (for which the maths was hard) and integrates with a middle tier proxy system as well as YouTube GData feeds and the YouTube Contest API.

		<title>Nissan Qashqai YouTube Masthead</title>

		<description>
		This was a quick and simple fix to a very high pressure campaign. Long story short: I got a call, on a Friday, telling me that this masthead was due to be served on YouTube (via DoubleClick) on a Monday and it didn't contain any DoubleClick components. Now since DoubleClick Studio components are essentially ported TangoZebra components and with all the work I did with DoubleClick, I knew how to fix this with my eyes closed. So, I went through the creative and it was ready to be served by Sunday night, just in time for Monday.

		<title>Google/YouTube Italy's That's Opera Talent Contest</title>

		<description>
		It's been a crazy start to 2010 with lots and lots of work under my belt and one was developing the Google/YouTube Italy's That's Opera Talent Contest. It's a YouTube contest where entrants compete to win tickets to the 56&#xb0; Festival Puccini in the summer. They enter by submitting a video of themselves singing or playing an instrument to music of Madam Butterfly Opera. The contest is a full custom built gadget and uses Google Appengine Python backend for email verification and as a proxy between the user and the contest API.

		<title>Fox's Avatar Interactive Trailer</title>

		<description>
		I was given the amazing opportunity by the guys at The PPC to work on the Avatar interactive trailer microsite. It wasn't the simplest of builds, but the concept was pretty simple. The biggest issue was making sure that the Flash could handle the rendering of the alpha channel videos with 3D panels without dragging too much processing power. The outcome was pretty perfect, although had I had more time I would've spent more time trying to claim back every bit of processing power!

		<title>Google's Give Chrome</title>

		<description>
		I recently got asked to help fix and put the finishing touches to Google's new 'Give Chrome' campaign. The site's server side code had to be rewritten in Python for Google's AppEngine, and the Actionscript code had to be cleaned up and updated, ready for working Facebook and Twitter integration and utilising the giving concept. It was a large project to take on, but I managed to get everything up and running within a couple of days, more work to come though!

		<title>IOC The Best Of Us Challenge</title>

		<description>
		A month of so ago I got contacted by an agency in the states who asked me to help them build a beast of a YouTube Contest Gadget for the Olympics IOC. The concept, 'The Best Of Us Challenge', was to have videos of athletes doing stuff that us mere mortals can compete with, such as, walking on your hands or balancing balls. It's a beautifully designed gadget and my task was to aid the team through the maze that is a YouTube Contest Gadget, helping with coding, integration of the player, the authentication and uploading of videos, creation of the proxy (and caching) all the way through to the tech review process. The site has now gone on to win an FWA SOTD Award!

		<title>Flash Video Player for 1Click2Fame.com</title>

		<id>a1c2fPlayer</id>
		<description>
		One of the main projects that I had to do at 1Click2Fame.com was to create their branded player. This is one of the most important assets of the site, for example, what would YouTube be without its player? The player needed to not only play videos but also deal with voting on a performance and also handle authentication (in situ) as well as being embedable on external site and having a JavaScript API.

		<title>Coutts Location Tool</title>

		<id>tzCoutts</id>
		<description>
			The Coutts Location Tool is a project that I created whilst working at Tangozebra, now part of Google. The client wanted an interactive and intuitive tool that allowed customers to see where Coutts branches are and how to get there. The idea was to embed Google Maps and use the Maps API to integrate fully with set locations as well as geocoding user's post codes and directions to Coutts branches.
